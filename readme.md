# Smart Expense Tracker
A Python-based console application to help users track, manage, and analyze day-to-day expenses using basic programming and algorithmic techniques.

Overview of the Project
This project is designed as part of the VITyarthi flipped course **CSE1021 – Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming**.

It demonstrates the practical use of lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries, loops, functions, conditionals, and basic algorithms by building a realistic and useful application.

The Smart Expense Tracker will allow the user to add expenses, view records, calculate monthly spending, find the highest expense, remove duplicates, and compute the Kth highest expense. It also provides a random expense generator for testing and demonstration purposes.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To implement real-world problem solving using Python.  
- To demonstrate algorithm design and application.  
- To apply concepts of data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets.  
- To use conditional and iterative statements effectively.  
- To design a modular Python program using functions.

## 🔧 Features  
### ✔ Add Expense  
Stores amount, category, and date inside a dictionary.  
### ✔ View All Expenses  
Displays all the stored expenses in a readable format.  
### ✔ Monthly Spending  
Uses summation algorithm to calculate total spending.  
### ✔ Highest Expense  
Finds the maximum amount using loop or max().  
### ✔ Remove Duplicate Entries  
Removes repeated expense records using sets.  
### ✔ Kth Highest Expense  
Sorts expenses and returns the Kth highest amount.  
### ✔ Random Expense Generation  
Adds a randomly generated test expense using `random` module.
